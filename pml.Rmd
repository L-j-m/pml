## How the model was built

Our outcome variable is classe, a factor variable with 5 levels. For this data set, â€œparticipants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in 5 different fashions:\

* exactly according to the specification (Class A)

* throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)

* lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)

* lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)

* throwing the hips to the front (Class E)?

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes." Prediction evaluations will be based on maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the out-of-sample error. All other available variables after cleaning will be used for prediction.

## Cross-validation

Cross-validation will be performed by subsampling our training data set randomly without replacement into 2 subsamples: subTraining data (75% of the original Training data set) and subTesting data (25%). Our models will be fitted on the subTraining data set, and tested on the subTesting data. Once the most accurate model is choosen, it will be tested on the original Testing data set.

## Setup
Prepare the packages that are needed in this file.
```{r}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)

set.seed(1234)
```

## Getting & Cleaning data
Get the data from url and load them.
```{r}
trainUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"

testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
```

Partioning training data set into two parts. 60% for traning, 40% for testing.
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
```

## Cleaning data
```{r}
myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
```

```{r}
myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
"kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
"max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
"var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
"stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
"kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
"max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
"kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
"skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
"amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
"skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
"max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
"amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
"avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
"stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")
myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]

dim(myTraining)
```


```{r}
myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]

trainingV3 <- myTraining #creating another subset to iterate in loop
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
        if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
            }   
        } 
    }
}
#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(trainingV3)
```

```{r}
myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)


clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58]) #already with classe column removed
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]

#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(myTesting)
dim(testing)
```

Change the data into same type.
```{r}
for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
        for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}
#And to make sure Coertion really worked, simple smart ass technique:
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) #note row 2 does not mean anything, this will be removed right.. now:
testing <- testing[-1,]
```

## Using Decision Tree for prediction
```{r}
modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")

fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)
```

Predicting:
```{r}
predictionsA1 <- predict(modFitA1, myTesting, type = "class")

confusionMatrix(predictionsA1, as.factor(myTesting$classe))
```

## Using Prandom Forests for prediction

```{r}
modFitB1 <- randomForest(as.factor(classe) ~., data=myTraining)

predictionsB1 <- predict(modFitB1, myTesting, type = "class")

confusionMatrix(predictionsB1, as.factor(myTesting$classe))
```
Random Forests model has a better result.


## Generating Files

```{r}
predictionsB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")
```

```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(predictionsB2)
```
